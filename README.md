# N-puzzle
N-puzzle solver in **JAVA** using Tree data structure

# Description

You will have an N by N array (based on 2-dimensional array), where you have numbers from 1 to N*N-1 and one empty element. The program will try to solve that array to have numbers ordered by only swapping empty element by an element on its side.<br/>
Methods used are based on Artificial Intelligence Searching Algorithms.<br/>
Note: 
- Some methods will have infinite loops which is totally normal. 


It was solved using many methods:
- DFS: Depth-First Search
- DLS: Depth Limited Search
- Greedy
- IDS: Iterative deepening search
- BFS: Breadth-First Search

# Build

You have to install Java environment and compile the required classes (methods) and run them
<br/>
**Enjoy :)**
